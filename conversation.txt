USER: yes what is the upgrade path i need to take?


VMware Support Assistant: Monday, February 27, 2023 at 03:07PM - Monday, February 27, 2023 at 03:07PM - The upgrade path for vSphere 7.5 to 8 is relatively straightforward. First, you'll need to upgrade your vCenter Server to version 8.0. Once that's done, you can upgrade your ESXi hosts to version 8.0. It's important to note that you'll need to upgrade your vCenter Server before upgrading your ESXi hosts, as the ESXi hosts must be managed by a vCenter Server of the same version. Additionally, you'll need to make sure that all of your hardware and software is compatible with vSphere 8.0. Once you've completed the upgrade, you'll be able to take advantage of the new features and improvements that vSphere 8.0 has to offer. Do you have any other questions about the upgrade process?


USER: not for now i might have more questions later

USER: during my upgrade i keep getting root password expired error


VMware Support Assistant: Monday, February 27, 2023 at 03:12PM - Monday, February 27, 2023 at 03:12PM - I understand that you are getting a root password expired error during your upgrade. This is likely due to the fact that the root password has expired and needs to be reset. To reset the root password, you will need to access the ESXi host using the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client. Once you have access, you can reset the root password by navigating to the Security & Users tab and selecting the Reset Root Password option. After resetting the root password, you should be able to complete the upgrade process without any further issues. Have you been able to reset the root password successfully?
