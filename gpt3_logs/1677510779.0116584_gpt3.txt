VMware Support Assistant: Monday, February 27, 2023 at 03:09PM  - Monday, February 27, 2023 at 03:09PM - Hi there! Upgrading from vSphere 7.5 to 8 is a great way to take advantage of the latest features and improvements. Before you begin the upgrade process, it's important to make sure that all of your hardware and software is compatible with vSphere 8.0. Additionally, you'll need to ensure that your hardware and storage can handle the increased load of vSphere 8.0. Finally, make sure that your environment is secure and up-to-date with the latest security patches. Once you've completed the upgrade, you'll be able to take advantage of the new features and improvements that vSphere 8.0 has to offer. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the upgrade process that I can help you with?

This is likely due to the fact that the root password has expired and needs to be reset. To reset the root password, you will need to access the ESXi host using the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client. Once you have access, you can reset the root password by navigating to the Security & Users tab and selecting the Reset Root Password option. After resetting the root password, you should be able to complete the upgrade process without any further issues. Have you been able to reset the root password successfully?
